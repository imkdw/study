"""
In this paper Arabic was investigated from the speech recognition problem
point of view. We propose a novel approach to build an Arabic Automated Speech
Recognition System (ASR). This system is based on the open source CMU Sphinx-4,
from the Carnegie Mellon University. CMU Sphinx is a large-vocabulary;
speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition system based on discrete
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We build a model using utilities from the
OpenSource CMU Sphinx. We will demonstrate the possible adaptability of this
system to Arabic voice recognition.
